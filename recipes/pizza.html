    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Neapolitan pizza is one of the most famous and beloved styles of pizza in the world. Originating from Naples, Italy, this pizza is known for its thin, chewy crust with a slightly crispy edge, simple yet high-quality toppings, and a quick baking time in a high-temperature oven. Made with just a few ingredients, the key to an authentic Neapolitan pizza is using the right type of flour, fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, and extra virgin olive oil.</p>
    
    <p>Traditional Neapolitan pizza follows strict guidelines, including a long fermentation process for the dough and a baking temperature of at least 800°F (430°C) in a wood-fired oven. While a home oven may not reach these temperatures, this recipe will show you how to make an amazing Neapolitan-style pizza using a pizza stone or steel. Let’s get started!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g (4 cups) 00 flour (or all-purpose flour if unavailable)</li>
        <li>325ml (1⅓ cups) water</li>
        <li>10g (2 tsp) sea salt</li>
        <li>3g (1 tsp) dry yeast (or 1g fresh yeast)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>300g (1⅓ cups) canned San Marzano tomatoes</li>
        <li>200g (7 oz) fresh mozzarella (preferably mozzarella di bufala or fior di latte)</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil for drizzling</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt for the sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the dough: In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the water. Add the flour and mix with your hands or a wooden spoon. After a minute, add the salt and continue mixing until a shaggy dough forms.        </li>
        <li>Knead the dough: Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a little flour, but avoid overdoing it.        </li>
        <li>First rise: Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap, and let it rise at room temperature for 8–12 hours. If you have time, refrigerate the dough for 24 hours for better flavor and texture.        </li>
        <li>Divide and shape: After the first rise, divide the dough into 2–4 equal portions, depending on the size of your pizzas. Shape each portion into a smooth ball, cover, and let them rest for another 2 hours.        </li>
        <li>Prepare the sauce: Crush the canned San Marzano tomatoes with your hands or a blender until smooth. Add a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil. Set aside.        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven: Place a pizza stone or steel in the oven and preheat it to the highest possible temperature (usually 500°F or 260°C). Let it heat for at least 45 minutes.        </li>
        <li>Shape the pizza: On a lightly floured surface, stretch one dough ball into a thin round, about 10–12 inches in diameter. Avoid using a rolling pin to keep the dough airy.        </li>
        <li>Add toppings: Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce on the dough, leaving about an inch of crust uncovered. Tear the mozzarella into small pieces and distribute them evenly. Add fresh basil leaves and a drizzle of olive oil.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza: Transfer the pizza onto the hot pizza stone using a pizza peel. Bake for 6–8 minutes, or until the crust is puffed and slightly charred, and the cheese is bubbly. If using a broiler, turn it on for the last 2 minutes for extra charring. </li>
        <li>Serve: Remove the pizza from the oven, let it cool for a minute, drizzle with more olive oil if desired, and enjoy immediately!        </li>
    </ol>
